# Advent of Code

Solutions to the advent of code problems using ES6 Javascript.

## Getting Started

### Run a solution
```
npm start {day} {part} {year}
```

The following would run year 2015 day 3 part 1

```
npm start 3 1 2015
```

### Add a day

```
npm run add-day {day} {part} {year}
```

The following would create top level 2016 directory if it does not already exist, create the day4 subdirectory, and add part1.js, part2.js and input.txt files to that directory:

```
npm run add-day 4 2016
```

### Note

Set the value in the `currentYear.js` file and then the year can be omitted in any of the commands.

### Prerequisites

Node v8+. 

## Running the tests

Testing to come.
